**About My Game**:

Hello Everyone! 

This is my game that I created using some Javascript and some cool CSS Animations!

In this game you have the option to play "Guess The Artist Singing" or "Guess The Song Playing". 

Both versions are are in the same order with the same songs, so if you guess the artists right, then try to guess the songs! If you guessed the songs correctly, then try to guess the artists who were singing them! It's a fun game, with no score board as this game is just purely for fun! If you get stuck, then just click on the "Skip This Song" button to move onto the next one! Hope you have fun playing my game and enjoy!!!! :)

**PLEASE NOTE**: The songs in my game were purchased from iTunes. This is a fun free game for people to enjoy that does not benefit me in any way, shape, form, or manner. I do not own any of the rights to any of the songs in my game. Also this game is non-profit and is for education purposes only.
